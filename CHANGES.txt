TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1. Removed the entire "Trusted By" section as it is not relevant to my personal portfolio

2. Changed the "Get Started" section ot a "Contact Me Section" Changed/removed/added components to better fit the needs of a personal portfolio.

3. Changed to testimonials section to a work history section. I took off the photo and the stars and added the appropriate content. I considered using this for referalls, but ultimately decided to use the section for work experience.

4. I added a section similar to the for education using cards. I feel This is an important thing to show on a portfolio.

5. I reduced the portfolio section to contain 6 projects rather than 9. I feel that 6 is enough to showcase your skills/expertice without overloading.
